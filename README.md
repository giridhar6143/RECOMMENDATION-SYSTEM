Task 4: Recommendation System

Task Description

Task 4 involves building a Recommendation System using Collaborative Filtering or Matrix Factorization techniques. Recommendation systems are widely used in platforms like Netflix, Amazon, and Spotify to suggest products or content based on user preferences.
Implementation Details
The task uses a dataset containing user-item interactions or ratings. The data is analyzed to understand user behavior and preference patterns. A collaborative filtering approach is implemented to recommend items based on similarity between users or items.
Alternatively, matrix factorization techniques are applied to uncover latent factors influencing user choices. These techniques help generate personalized recommendations.
Evaluation
The recommendation system is evaluated using suitable metrics such as prediction accuracy or error measures. Sample recommendations are displayed to demonstrate system effectiveness.
Deliverable
A Jupyter Notebook or application showcasing:
•	Recommendation logic
•	Generated recommendations
•	Evaluation metrics
